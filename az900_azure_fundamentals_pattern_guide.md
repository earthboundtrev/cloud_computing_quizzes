## ☁️ Describe Cloud Concepts (25–30%)

### **Cloud Computing Definition**
**Signal:** "Define cloud computing", "on-demand", "shared resources", "internet"
**Answer:** **Cloud computing** = delivery of compute, storage, networking, and other services over the internet on demand; shared resources, rapid elasticity, pay-as-you-go
**Why:** Foundational definition; know it for "what is the cloud" questions
**Gut Check:** On-demand + shared + pay-as-you-go → cloud computing

### **Shared Responsibility Model**
**Signal:** "Shared responsibility", "who is responsible", "customer vs cloud provider", "security responsibility"
**Answer:** **Shared responsibility** — provider secures *infrastructure* (physical, network, host); customer secures *data, apps, identity, access, OS/config* (depending on IaaS/PaaS/SaaS)
**Why:** Same idea as AWS; more customer responsibility in IaaS, less in SaaS
**Gut Check:** "Who patches the OS?" IaaS = you. PaaS/SaaS = provider. "Who secures the building?" = provider

### **Cloud Models - Public, Private, Hybrid**
**Signal:** "Public cloud", "private cloud", "hybrid cloud", "use case", "appropriate model"
**Answer:**
- **Public:** Resources shared, multi-tenant, over internet (e.g., Azure, AWS) — general workloads, scale, cost-effective
- **Private:** Dedicated to one org, on-prem or hosted — strict compliance, legacy, control
- **Hybrid:** Mix of public + private (often with connectivity) — gradual migration, burst, regulatory
**Why:** Exam asks which model fits a scenario
**Gut Check:** "Need strict compliance + control" → Private. "Need scale + low cost" → Public. "Both" → Hybrid

### **Consumption-Based Model**
**Signal:** "Consumption-based", "pay as you go", "no upfront", "operational expense"
**Answer:** **Consumption-based** = pay only for what you use; no upfront CapEx; OpEx model
**Why:** Core cloud benefit; contrasts with traditional buy-and-maintain
**Gut Check:** Pay for usage only → consumption-based

### **Cloud Pricing Models**
**Signal:** "Reserved", "spot", "free tier", "compare pricing"
**Answer:** **Pay-as-you-go**, **Reservations** (commit for 1–3 years, discount), **Spot** (interruptible, cheaper), **Free tier** (limited free services)
**Why:** Aligns with cost optimization; know when to use each
**Gut Check:** Predictable long-term → Reservations. Fault-tolerant/interruptible → Spot

### **Serverless**
**Signal:** "Serverless", "no infrastructure", "event-driven", "scale to zero"
**Answer:** **Serverless** = run code/functions without managing servers; automatic scale, pay per execution (e.g., Azure Functions)
**Why:** PaaS subset; no servers to manage
**Gut Check:** No servers + event-driven → serverless (e.g., Azure Functions)

### **Benefits of Cloud - High Availability & Scalability**
**Signal:** "High availability", "scalability", "elastic", "scale out", "scale up"
**Answer:** **HA** = multiple copies/zones; **Scalability** = vertical (bigger VM) or horizontal (more instances); **Elasticity** = auto scale with demand
**Why:** Benefits section; know vertical vs horizontal
**Gut Check:** "More machines" → horizontal. "Bigger machine" → vertical.

### **Benefits - Reliability, Predictability, Security, Manageability**
**Signal:** "Reliability", "predictability", "security", "manageability", "benefits"
**Answer:** **Reliability** = SLA, redundancy; **Predictability** = predictable performance/cost; **Security** = provider + tools; **Manageability** = portals, automation, templates
**Why:** Conceptual; often in "describe benefits" questions
**Gut Check:** Match keyword to benefit

### **Cloud Service Types - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**
**Signal:** "IaaS", "PaaS", "SaaS", "use case", "who manages what"
**Answer:**
- **IaaS:** You manage OS, apps, data; provider = compute, network, storage (e.g., Azure VMs)
- **PaaS:** You manage apps + data; provider = runtime, OS, infrastructure (e.g., Azure App Service)
- **SaaS:** You use the app; provider manages everything (e.g., Microsoft 365)
**Why:** Most-tested concept; know the stack each side manages
**Gut Check:** "Manage the OS?" → IaaS. "Just deploy code?" → PaaS. "Use an app in browser?" → SaaS

### **IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS - Key Distinction**
**⚠️ Critical Distinction:**
- **IaaS** = VM, you patch OS, install software (max control, max management)
- **PaaS** = App Service, Functions, you deploy code only (less ops)
- **SaaS** = Email, CRM, no infrastructure (just use it)
- **Exam Trap:** "Migrate with minimal management" → PaaS. "Full control over OS" → IaaS.

## 📝 Common Red Herrings to Avoid

- **"Azure AD"** is now **Microsoft Entra ID** — same product, name change.
- **"Availability Set"** vs **Availability Zone** — Zones = preferred for new HA; Sets = legacy fault domains.
- **"Advisor"** = recommendations; **"Service Health"** = Azure status; **"Monitor"** = your metrics/logs.
- **"Policy"** = Azure Policy (governance). **"Purview"** = data governance/catalog.
- **"Private endpoint"** = private connectivity to a specific PaaS resource; not "private subnet."
- **"Resource group"** = one resource in one RG (can move); not "one RG per resource type."
- **"Subscription"** = billing boundary; **"Management group"** = hierarchy above subscriptions.
- **LRS vs ZRS vs GRS** — Match scenario: region failure → GRS; AZ failure → ZRS.
